[h1]Different personalities? Different objectives![/h1][/hr]
[hr][/hr]
Rulers and vassals now have different objectives when negotiating their contracts, and those objectives will vary depending on their personalities.
A greedy ruler might be willing to give up two levels of Levies, in order to get one more level of Taxes,
a dishonorable vassal will pursue lower obligation levels more aggressively,
a cowardly vassal will seek Title Revocation Protection rights - especially if the liege is both vengeful and dishonorable!

Feudal power dynamics are now much more fluid, as vassal contracts reflect the priorities of both parties involved, and no two negotiations are really the same anymore!

[h1]More flexible negotiations - without incurring Tyranny[/h1][/hr]
[hr][/hr]
Now that the AI properly knows how to negotiate, two limitations have been lifted from the system:
- you can now negotiate any Tax or Lavies obligation level, and are not limited to just the next higher or lower level
- you can now make as many changes to the contract as you like, as long as the other party is willing to trade for them

By negotiating according to the other party's personnality, you can now make drastic changes to a vassal contract without incurring Tyranny for it!
When negotiating against the AI, a new Acceptance bar will show whether the other party accepts the current contract, or whether you have to give something up to get what you really want.

[h1]Don't like the micro? Delegate![/h1][/hr]

Don't want to bother handling contract negotiation with your 78 vassals?
When you assign your Chancellor to the Domestic Affairs councillor task, he will take care of that for you, and will handle the negotiations just like your character would if he was handled by the AI - except for Powerful Vassals, who will still need to be handled by the player, as they are too important to be brushed aside.

Message notifications will alert you whenever a negotiation fails or succeeds, so you can still keep an eye on what's going on, even if you weren't really in the room where it happened!

[h1]Proper PvP negotiation system[/h1][/hr]
[hr][/hr]
When starting a negotiation against another player, a back-and-forth will begin, wherein each player proposes one or more changes to the contract.
Once a proposal has been sent, the terms changed in that proposal are set, and the other player can either:
- accept the proposal, and the new contract is set
- reject the proposal, the negotiation ends, and the old contract is kept unchanged
- send a counter-proposal with more changes
