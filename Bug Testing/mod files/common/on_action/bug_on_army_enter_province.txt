# # When using on_army_enter_province, scope:army.location doesn't work properly when the player's army crosses into his realm from a foreign province, or out of his realm into a foreign province.

# # Intended behaviour is :
# # Own -> Own : pos, if
# # Own -> Foreign : neg
# # Foreign -> Foreign : neg
# # Foreign -> Own : pos, if

# # How to read : if army moves from Own province to Own province, on_test_pos and on_test_if should trigger, so the player should get both gold and piety
# # Problem is : when the player crosses into his realm from a foreign province, or out of his realm into a foreign province, in thoses 2 instances player doesn't get what he should.

# # Recorded behaviour is :
# # Own -> Own : pos, if
# # Own -> Foreign : null
# # Foreign -> Foreign : neg
# # Foreign -> Own : if

# # commented out block :
# # when commented back in, it adds an additionnal on_action layer, which somehow solves the issue.
